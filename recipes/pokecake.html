        <li>Make cake: Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease a 9"-x-13" baking pan with cooking spray. Prepare cake according to package directions. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean, 20 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Make filling: In a medium bowl, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Make frosting: In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter together until no lumps remain. Add powdered sugar and beat until smooth, then add in vanilla and a pinch of salt. Fold in whipped cream until just combined.</li>
        <li>Using the bottom of a wooden spoon, poke holes all over cake. Pour filling over and use a rubber spatula to push into holes. Frost with cream cheese frosting. Refrigerate 20 minutes before serving.</li>
